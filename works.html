		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hi, I'm Mateo Yadarola, a Product Designer who values the journey as much as the destination. My design journey spans over two decades, with more than ten years in leadership roles. What keeps me going? The unyielding joy of transforming intricate problems into elegant, user-centric solutions.</p>
		<p>I'm currently at Continental Finance, where I'm shaping a mobile home banking app catering to users with poor credit scores. Beyond my 9-to-5, I'm an experimenter, a creator of side projects that aim to enhance the digital experience. Check out my GitHub; it's my digital playground where tools like ChronoMouse and MenuMaestro come to life.</p>			
		<p>Beyond the professional arena, I wear multiple hatsâ€”a mentor fostering growth, a continuous learner, and a community builder. The <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Mentoreo-MenteeMentor-c5lyQ5Ad9d9ff3QfiIIxd" target="_blank">Mentoring Template</a> is my contribution to effective mentor-mentee relationships, and an open invitation for feedback in <a href="https://calendar.app.google/2oCmcWsNkdEQZhBF7" target="_blank">my calendar</a> is an acknowledgment of my curiosity about people's stories.</p>

		<h2>Questions that Sparked Personal Projects</h2>
		<h3>What if switches had progress indicators?</h3>
		<p>Just moved into a place, and the light switches were a jumble. The fixtures are in a row, so I made labels for each key: "<code>â–¡ â–¡ â–¡ ðŸž» â–¡</code>". Simple but effective. Now, no more guessing. Designing for clarity matters, even in the smallest details.</p>
		<h3>What if using real data in Figma was simpler?</h3>
		<p>While looking for ways in which we could bring real data into our designs I found a Figma plugin called Google sheets sync, which pretty much does what it says. It allows you to sync data in a google sheet with specific layers in your designs, but it lacks a way to import working clickable links. On a hack day, I decided to create <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1284214046492867185/anchorify" target="_blank">Anchorify</a>, a Figma Plugin for converting <code>[text](url)</code> and <code>[url=url]text[/url]</code> links into clickable hyperlinks. Another plugin, <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1285425464785405153/word-hugger" target="_blank">Word Hugger</a>, refines text elements with isolated words, known as "orphans," ensuring a polished paragraph layout by grouping together the last couple of words. Because every word deserves company.</p>
		<h3>What if accessing application menus was as intuitive as thinking about them?</h3>
		<img src="/menumaestro.png" loading=lazy>
		<p>Introduced <a href="https://github.com/sryo/Spoons/blob/main/MenuMaestro.lua" target="_blank">MenuMaestro</a>, a tool that simplifies menu navigation, cutting down the distance between a thought and an action. Instead of sifting through dropdowns, users type what they're thinking and directly execute commands. Because sometimes, it's the legacy interfaces that hold the most room for reinvention.</p>
		<h3>What if I could see time without looking at the corner?</h3>
		<img src="/chronomouse.svg" loading=lazy>
		<p>In July 2023, I brought a personal idea to life by building <a href="https://github.com/sryo/ChronoMouse" target="_blank">ChronoMouse</a>, a tool to keep track of time right beside the cursor. This project was more than just a coding exercise; it was a realization of a concept that came from recognizing a need in my own workflow. Learning to program in Swift allowed me to take control of the entire process, from the initial idea to the finished product, reinforcing the power of integrating design and development skills.</p>
		<h3>What if my touchpad could do more than just point and click?</h3>
		<div class="video-responsive">
			<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PQBv28n0zno?si=2F75WTutySao2zXC" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
		</div>
		<p>This month, I've been tinkering with my digital workspace. I started wondering: what if my touchpad worked as a keyboard? From this thought, <a href="https://github.com/sryo/Spoons/blob/main/TrackpadWizard.lua" target="_blank">TrackpadWizard</a> was born. It's still a work in progress, but I'm happy with what I've accomplished so far. In addition, I created <a href="https://github.com/sryo/Spoons/blob/main/HyperlinkHijacker.lua" target="_blank">HyperlinkHijacker</a>, a no-fuss tool to control your hyperlink destinations. Click a link, and you get a list of browsers/profiles to choose from.</p>
		<img src="/hyperlinkhijacker.png" loading=lazy>
		<h3>What if blogging was as simple as sending an email?</h3>
		<p>Emails have always been an intuitive self-publishing tool, yet confined to specific recipients. To overcome this, I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/sryo/GmailScripts/blob/master/email2Web.gs" target="_blank">Google Apps script</a> that adds a public folder to your Gmail account. This endeavor highlights the innovation possible when we reimagine the potential of everyday tools.</p>
		<h3>What if guides became more than just manuals?</h3>
		<p>As the team leader for Bancor's digital banking project, I enjoyed shaping our team culture and creating effective work methodologies. I developed several crucial guides to facilitate high-quality digital services. The "<a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Mapa-para-el-trabajo-en-celulas-de-diseno-de-servicios--B8677ogIMpRps35~13RXNCtEAg-E4ksYMIbfziVfFh6OclLL" target="_blank">Map for Service Design Cells</a>" provided a thorough framework for digital service success, covering empathy, problem-solving, governance, improvement, security, and data-driven decisions. The "<a	href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Guia-de-diseno-de-experiencias-digitales-para-no-disenadores--B85z2HRzyTsK2waD2tzT7WAgAg-aU8DHRJ5HIFOVZwdzBPNZ" target="_blank">Digital Experience Design Guide for Non-Designers</a>" helped build consistent user interfaces by clarifying design elements, offering UX writing tips, and navigating flows. I also made an <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Te-banco-Guia-para-anfitriones-de-Banca-digital--B84igP4lu9Rw3Wp__JajUKa3Ag-4Igni3zHe2z8ZDPhwNOak" target="_blank">onboarding guide</a> for smoother transitions for new team members. These guides were not just instruction manuals; they represented our shared values and sought to foster an inclusive environment that encouraged collaboration and continuous learning. As we continue to refine our digital banking services, I look forward to the lasting impact of these efforts.</p>

		<h2>A Gamified Banking Experience</h2>
		<p><strong>Client:</strong> Continental Finance - Finance and insurance</p>
		<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Qualifying for a credit card is not easy when you have a poor credit score or none at all. Around 48 million Americans are deemed to have bad credit. How can we help our users grow their credit line while also teaching them why thatâ€™s important?</p>
		<p>To address the challenge of helping users improve their credit score and increase their credit line, our team focused on human motivations rather than simply adding features to the app.</p>
		<p>To align motivations, goals, and tasks, we gamified the experience of learning about personal finance and credit management, making it an interactive and enjoyable journey for users to improve their financial literacy. By highlighting budgeting and other behaviors into the app, we are able to guide users towards actions that will help them reduce their spending and improve their credit score. This approach not only helps users qualify for credit cards but also teaches them the importance of building and maintaining a good credit score.</p>
		<p>Our new app has been well-received by users, with many reporting significant improvements in their credit score and overall financial knowledge.</p>

		<h2>Banking Made Simple: The Public Bank E-wallet</h2>
		<p><strong>Client:</strong> Bancor - Finance and insurance</p>
		<p><strong>Overview:</strong> According to Veritran in Argentina, 7 out of 10 users choose to do their digital transactions through a virtual wallet instead of their bank home banking app, and 3 out of 10 still go to a physical branch for operations that they consider to be of greater importance, such as the transfer of large amounts, the request for loans, or the subscription of time deposits. How can we transform an antiquated industry through User-Centered Design and drive the future of finance forward, providing an experience that is easily navigated by each of the bank's key audiences and meets each of their unique needs?</p>
		<p>In response to the increasing popularity of virtual wallets and the need for an improved user experience in the banking industry, our team implemented a user-centered design approach to modernize the bank's mobile app. By streamlining the most commonly used flows and incorporating new features that cater to the unique needs of our key audiences (older adults, public employees, students, and business owners), we were able to transform the outdated experience and drive the future of finance forward. As a result, our app saw significant growth in 2021, with over 845,000 individuals and 18,200 companies using the app, and over 68,400 new customers onboarded.</p>

		<h2>Where's my Card: Real-time Delivery Tracking</h2>
		<p><strong>Client:</strong> Bancor - Finance and insurance</p>
		<p><strong>Overview:</strong> The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the demand for traditional postal services hard. How can we reduce user anxiety while a country-wide quarantine extends card shipping delays?</p>
		<p>To address the challenges posed by the Covid restrictions and extended quarantine, our team worked closely with our postal service provider to develop solutions that would reduce user anxiety and alleviate shipping delays. We implemented a feature that allows regular credit and debit card users to track their parcel delivery directly from their homebanking app. This provides users with peace of mind and allows them to stay informed about the status of their delivery. Additionally, we enabled users to make transfers and payments using their debit and prepaid cards even if the physical card has not yet arrived. This allows users to continue accessing their funds and conducting transactions without having to wait for their physical card to arrive. Overall, these solutions have helped to improve the user experience and reduce anxiety for our customers during the pandemic.</p>

		<p><strong>Overview:</strong> How can we pivot a Demolition and Construction rental web directory into an online communication, scheduling, booking, and billing for our home service partners?</p>
		<p>In a short time, our team designed and developed a new onboarding experience and job booking flow. We also added new management tools, including calendar, kanban, and map views for job orders, as well as route navigation and internal messaging capabilities.</p>
		<p>These features enable businesses to easily manage their fleet and complete tasks from booking to invoicing. This new platform allows home service providers to communicate, schedule, book, and bill their clients more efficiently, helping to improve their overall business operations.</p>

		<h2>A New Perspective: E-commerce for Satellite Imagery</h2>
		<p><strong>Client:</strong> VENG - Aerospace and Defense</p>
		<p><strong>Overview:</strong> SAOCOM is a constellation of two high-resolution satellites that are capable of observing Earth's surface around the clock, regardless of weather conditions. What would an e-commerce of its catalog and future satellite images look like?</p>
		<p>I conceptualized an e-commerce platform for searching, requesting, and paying for satellite images provided by these satellites.</p>
		<p>This new web app allows users to easily browse and purchase images from the SAOCOM 1A & B satellites, providing them with access to valuable information and insights about Earth's surface. This platform not only provides a convenient way for users to access and purchase satellite images but also helps to promote the use of these advanced satellite technologies.</p>

		<p> In order to streamline the onboarding process for Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeons, our team set out to consolidate the 112 different forms they were required to fill out.</p>
		<p>We began by iterating over multiple ideas for a conversational quoting tool, allowing surgeons to quickly and easily provide the necessary information. After conducting user testing and gathering feedback, we refined and improved the tool, creating a fast and compelling onboarding experience for surgeons. This streamlined process has improved the user experience and made it easier for surgeons to complete the onboarding process.</p>
