		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hi, I'm Mateo Yadarola, a Product Designer who values the journey as much as the destination. My design journey
			spans over two decades, with more than ten years in leadership roles. What keeps me going? The unyielding joy of
			transforming intricate problems into elegant, user-centric solutions.</p>
		<p>I'm currently at Continental Finance, where I'm shaping a mobile home banking app catering to users with poor
			credit scores. Beyond my 9-to-5, I'm an experimenter, a creator of side projects that aim to enhance the digital
			experience. Check out my GitHub; it's my digital playground where tools like ChronoMouse and MenuMaestro come to
			life.</p>
		<p>Beyond the professional arena, I wear multiple hats—a mentor fostering growth, a continuous learner, and a
			community builder. The <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Mentoreo-MenteeMentor-c5lyQ5Ad9d9ff3QfiIIxd"
				target="_blank">Mentoring Template</a> is my contribution to effective mentor-mentee relationships, and an open
			invitation for feedback in <a href="https://calendar.app.google/2oCmcWsNkdEQZhBF7" target="_blank">my calendar</a>
			is an acknowledgment of my curiosity about people's stories.</p>

		<p><strong>Questions that Sparked Personal Projects:</strong></p>
		<h3>What if switches had progress indicators?</h3>
		<img src="/switch.svg" loading=lazy alt="□ □ □ 🞻 □">
		<p>Just moved into a place, and the light switches were a jumble. The fixtures are in a row, so I made labels for
			each key: "<code>□ □ □ 🞻 □</code>". Simple but effective. Now, no more guessing. Designing for clarity matters,
			even in the smallest details.</p>
		<h3>What if using real data in Figma was simpler?</h3>
		<p>While looking for ways in which we could bring real data into our designs I found a Figma plugin called Google
			sheets sync, which pretty much does what it says. It allows you to sync data in a google sheet with specific
			layers in your designs, but it lacks a way to import working clickable links. On a hack day, I decided to create
			<a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1284214046492867185/anchorify" target="_blank">Anchorify</a>, a
			Figma Plugin for converting <code>[text](url)</code> and <code>[url=url]text[/url]</code> links into clickable
			hyperlinks. Another plugin, <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1285425464785405153/word-hugger"
				target="_blank">Word Hugger</a>, refines text elements with isolated words, known as "orphans," ensuring a
			polished paragraph layout by grouping together the last couple of words. Because every word deserves company.
		</p>
		<h3>What if accessing application menus was as intuitive as thinking about them?</h3>
		<img src="/menumaestro.png" loading=lazy>
		<p>Introduced <a href="https://github.com/sryo/Spoons/blob/main/MenuMaestro.lua" target="_blank">MenuMaestro</a>, a
			tool that simplifies menu navigation, cutting down the distance between a thought and an action. Instead of
			sifting through dropdowns, users type what they're thinking and directly execute commands. Because sometimes, it's
			the legacy interfaces that hold the most room for reinvention.</p>
		<h3>What if I could see time without looking at the corner?</h3>
		<img src="/chronomouse.svg" loading=lazy>
		<p>In July 2023, I brought a personal idea to life by building <a href="https://github.com/sryo/ChronoMouse"
				target="_blank">ChronoMouse</a>, a tool to keep track of time right beside the cursor. This project was more
			than just a coding exercise; it was a realization of a concept that came from recognizing a need in my own
			workflow. Learning to program in Swift allowed me to take control of the entire process, from the initial idea to
			the finished product, reinforcing the power of integrating design and development skills.</p>
		<h3>What if my touchpad could do more than just point and click?</h3>
		<div class="video-responsive">
			<iframe width="560" height="315" loading="lazy"
				src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PQBv28n0zno?si=2F75WTutySao2zXC" frameborder="0"
				allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
				allowfullscreen></iframe>
		</div>
		<p>This month, I've been tinkering with my digital workspace. I started wondering: what if my touchpad worked as a
			keyboard? From this thought, <a href="https://github.com/sryo/Spoons/blob/main/TrackpadWizard.lua"
				target="_blank">TrackpadWizard</a> was born. It's still a work in progress, but I'm happy with what I've
			accomplished so far. In addition, I created <a
				href="https://github.com/sryo/Spoons/blob/main/HyperlinkHijacker.lua" target="_blank">HyperlinkHijacker</a>, a
			no-fuss tool to control your hyperlink destinations. Click a link, and you get a list of browsers/profiles to
			choose from.</p>
		<img src="/hyperlinkhijacker.png" loading=lazy>
		<h3>What if blogging was as simple as sending an email?</h3>
		<p>Emails have always been an intuitive self-publishing tool, yet confined to specific recipients. To overcome this,
			I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/sryo/GmailScripts/blob/master/email2Web.gs" target="_blank">Google Apps
				script</a> that adds a public folder to your Gmail account. This endeavor highlights the innovation possible
			when we reimagine the potential of everyday tools.</p>
		<h3>What if guides became more than just manuals?</h3>
		<p>As the team leader for Bancor's digital banking project, I enjoyed shaping our team culture and creating
			effective work methodologies. I developed several crucial guides to facilitate high-quality digital services. The
			"<a
				href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Mapa-para-el-trabajo-en-celulas-de-diseno-de-servicios--B8677ogIMpRps35~13RXNCtEAg-E4ksYMIbfziVfFh6OclLL"
				target="_blank">Map for Service Design Cells</a>" provided a thorough framework for digital service success,
			covering empathy, problem-solving, governance, improvement, security, and data-driven decisions. The "<a
				href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Guia-de-diseno-de-experiencias-digitales-para-no-disenadores--B85z2HRzyTsK2waD2tzT7WAgAg-aU8DHRJ5HIFOVZwdzBPNZ"
				target="_blank">Digital Experience Design Guide for Non-Designers</a>" helped build consistent user interfaces
			by clarifying design elements, offering UX writing tips, and navigating flows. I also made an <a
				href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Te-banco-Guia-para-anfitriones-de-Banca-digital--B84igP4lu9Rw3Wp__JajUKa3Ag-4Igni3zHe2z8ZDPhwNOak"
				target="_blank">onboarding guide</a> for smoother transitions for new team members. These guides were not just
			instruction manuals; they represented our shared values and sought to foster an inclusive environment that
			encouraged collaboration and continuous learning. As we continue to refine our digital banking services, I look
			forward to the lasting impact of these efforts.</p>

		<h2>A Gamified Banking Experience</h2>
		<p><strong>Client:</strong> Continental Finance - Finance and insurance</p>
		<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Qualifying for a credit card is not easy when you have a poor credit score or none at
			all. Around 48 million Americans are deemed to have bad credit. How can we help our users grow their credit line
			while also teaching them why that’s important?</p>
		<p>To address the challenge of helping users improve their credit score and increase their credit line, our team
			focused on human motivations rather than simply adding features to the app.</p>
		<p>To align motivations, goals, and tasks, we gamified the experience of learning about personal finance and credit
			management, making it an interactive and enjoyable journey for users to improve their financial literacy. By
			highlighting budgeting and other behaviors into the app, we are able to guide users towards actions that will help
			them reduce their spending and improve their credit score. This approach not only helps users qualify for credit
			cards but also teaches them the importance of building and maintaining a good credit score.</p>
		<p>Our new app has been well-received by users, with many reporting significant improvements in their credit score
			and overall financial knowledge.</p>

		<h2>Banking Made Simple: The Public Bank E-wallet</h2>
		<p><strong>Client:</strong> Bancor - Finance and insurance</p>
		<p><strong>Overview:</strong> According to Veritran in Argentina, 7 out of 10 users choose to do their digital
			transactions through a virtual wallet instead of their bank home banking app, and 3 out of 10 still go to a
			physical branch for operations that they consider to be of greater importance, such as the transfer of large
			amounts, the request for loans, or the subscription of time deposits. How can we transform an antiquated industry
			through User-Centered Design and drive the future of finance forward, providing an experience that is easily
			navigated by each of the bank's key audiences and meets each of their unique needs?</p>
		<p>In response to the increasing popularity of virtual wallets and the need for an improved user experience in the
			banking industry, our team implemented a user-centered design approach to modernize the bank's mobile app. By
			streamlining the most commonly used flows and incorporating new features that cater to the unique needs of our key
			audiences (older adults, public employees, students, and business owners), we were able to transform the outdated
			experience and drive the future of finance forward. As a result, our app saw significant growth in 2021, with over
			845,000 individuals and 18,200 companies using the app, and over 68,400 new customers onboarded.</p>

		<h2>Where's my Card: Real-time Delivery Tracking</h2>
		<p><strong>Client:</strong> Bancor - Finance and insurance</p>
		<p><strong>Overview:</strong> The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the demand for traditional postal services hard. How can
			we reduce user anxiety while a country-wide quarantine extends card shipping delays?</p>
		<p>To address the challenges posed by the Covid restrictions and extended quarantine, our team worked closely with
			our postal service provider to develop solutions that would reduce user anxiety and alleviate shipping delays. We
			implemented a feature that allows regular credit and debit card users to track their parcel delivery directly from
			their homebanking app. This provides users with peace of mind and allows them to stay informed about the status of
			their delivery. Additionally, we enabled users to make transfers and payments using their debit and prepaid cards
			even if the physical card has not yet arrived. This allows users to continue accessing their funds and conducting
			transactions without having to wait for their physical card to arrive. Overall, these solutions have helped to
			improve the user experience and reduce anxiety for our customers during the pandemic.</p>

		<h2>News in a Nutshell: The Media Clipping App</h2>
		<p><strong>Client:</strong> Infoxel - Media, Printing, and Publishing</p>
		<p><strong>Overview:</strong> As politicians, journalists, and brand managers, staying on top of how your brand is
			being represented in the media can be a daunting task. With the constant flow of news and information, it can be
			difficult to keep track of every mention of your brand in TV, radio, and newspapers.</p>
		<p>To address this challenge, we decided to develop Vlic, a mobile app that would allow our users to quickly and
			easily see how their brand was being represented in the media as soon as news happened. With a team of skilled
			engineers, we set out to build a new media clipping product that would provide targeted information consumption
			and reduce the reliance on third-party applications. Thanks to our media clipping app, politicians, journalists,
			and brand managers are now able to stay on top of how their brand is being represented in the media, and make
			informed decisions about their public image.</p>
		<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Real-time notifications: Immediate notifications whenever the brand is mentioned in the media.</li>
			<li>Customizable feeds: Users can customize feeds to see news related to their specific brand.</li>
			<li>Easy sharing: Quick and easy sharing of news stories related to the brand with colleagues and followers.</li>
