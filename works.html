			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p> Hi, I'm Mateo Yadarola, a Product Designer who values the journey as much as the destination. My design journey spans over two decades, with more than ten years in leadership roles. </p>
			<p> I'm currently at Continental Finance, where I'm shaping a mobile home banking app catering to users with poor credit scores. Beyond my 9-to-5, I'm an experimenter, a creator of side projects that aim to enhance the digital experience. Check out my GitHub; it's my digital playground where tools like ChronoMouse and MenuMaestro come to life. </p>

			<p>I believe that creativity is a muscle—one that must be exercised regularly to be strengthened. This philosophy drives not only my professional work but also my passion for personal projects and experimentation. </p>
			<p>Join me as I explore the question: "What if...?" in design and technology. Each project below represents a different way I've challenged myself to think creatively, push the boundaries of what's possible in our digital world, and find joy in the journey of creation and problem-solving.</p>

								<h4>What if icons are the problem?</h4>
								<p>People spend over 10 hours a day on screens. Teens average nearly 9 hours daily. Digital addiction has become a significant concern, driven by social media, algorithmic feeds, and persistent notifications. In response, I designed <a href="https://github.com/sryo/scriptables">ZenTrate</a>—a set of iOS widgets using Scriptable—drawing from digital minimalism and the simplicity of old point-and-click adventure games. ZenTrate replaces cluttered screens of colorful icons with a calm commands palette focused on verbs like "Pay" instead of navigating through a bank app, or "Set Timer" instead of opening the clocks app. By adapting to user behavior and enlarging frequently used actions, we can offer a more intentional and streamlined approach to technology use aiming to reduce the cognitive load and help users manage their screen time more effectively.</p>

								<h4>What if using real data in Figma was simpler?</h4>
								<p>While looking for ways in which we could bring real data into our designs I found a Figma plugin called Google sheets sync, which pretty much does what it says. It allows you to sync data in a google sheet with specific layers in your designs, but it lacks a way to import working clickable links. On a hack day, I decided to create <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1284214046492867185/anchorify" target="_blank">Anchorify</a>, a Figma Plugin for converting <code>[text](url)</code> and <code>[url=url]text[/url]</code> links into clickable hyperlinks. Another plugin, <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1285425464785405153/word-hugger" target="_blank">Word Hugger</a>, refines text elements with isolated words, known as "orphans," ensuring a polished paragraph layout by grouping together the last couple of words. Because every word deserves company.</p>

								<h4>What if menus were as intuitive as our thoughts?</h4>
								<p>Introduced <a href="https://github.com/sryo/Spoons/blob/main/MenuMaestro.lua" target="_blank">MenuMaestro</a>, a tool that simplifies menu navigation, cutting down the distance between a thought and an action. Instead of sifting through dropdowns, users type what they're thinking and directly execute commands. Because sometimes, it's the legacy interfaces that hold the most room for reinvention.</p>

								<h4>What if cursors told the time?</h4>
								<p>In July 2023, I brought a personal idea to life by building <a href="https://github.com/sryo/ChronoMouse" target="_blank">ChronoMouse</a>, a tool to keep track of time right beside the cursor. This project was more than just a coding exercise; it was a realization of a concept that came from recognizing a need in my own workflow. Learning to program in Swift allowed me to take control of the entire process, from the initial idea to the finished product, reinforcing the power of integrating design and development skills.</p>

								<h4>What if touchpads typed?</h4>
								<p>This month, I've been tinkering with my digital workspace. I started wondering: what if my touchpad worked as a keyboard? From this thought, <a href="https://github.com/sryo/Spoons/blob/main/TrackpadWizard.lua" target="_blank">TrackpadWizard</a> was born. It's still a work in progress, but I'm happy with what I've accomplished so far. In addition, I created <a href="https://github.com/sryo/Spoons/blob/main/HyperlinkHijacker.lua" target="_blank">HyperlinkHijacker</a>, a no-fuss tool to control your hyperlink destinations. Click a link, and you get a list of browsers/profiles to choose from.</p>

			<h2>A Gamified Banking Experience</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Client:</strong> Continental Finance - Finance and insurance
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Overview:</strong> Qualifying for a credit card is not easy when you have a poor credit score or none at all. Around 48 million Americans are deemed to have bad credit. How can we help our users grow their credit line while also teaching them why that’s important?
			</p>
			<p>To address the challenge of helping users improve their credit score and increase their credit line, our team focused on human motivations rather than simply adding features to the app.</p>
			<p>To align motivations, goals, and tasks, we gamified the experience of learning about personal finance and credit management, making it an interactive and enjoyable journey for users to improve their financial literacy. By highlighting budgeting and other behaviors into the app, we are able to guide users towards actions that will help them reduce their spending and improve their credit score. This approach not only helps users qualify for credit cards but also teaches them the importance of building and maintaining a good credit score.</p>
			<p>Our new app has been well-received by users, with many reporting significant improvements in their credit score and overall financial knowledge.</p>

			<h2>Banking Made Simple: The Public Bank E-wallet</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Client:</strong> Bancor - Finance and insurance
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Overview:</strong> According to Veritran in Argentina, 7 out of 10 users choose to do their digital transactions through a virtual wallet instead of their bank home banking app, and 3 out of 10 still go to a physical branch for operations that they consider to be of greater importance, such as the transfer of large amounts, the request for loans, or the subscription of time deposits. How can we transform an antiquated industry through User-Centered Design and drive the future of finance forward, providing an experience that is easily navigated by each of the bank's key audiences and meets each of their unique needs?
			</p>
			<p>In response to the increasing popularity of virtual wallets and the need for an improved user experience in the banking industry, our team implemented a user-centered design approach to modernize the bank's mobile app. By streamlining the most commonly used flows and incorporating new features that cater to the unique needs of our key audiences (older adults, public employees, students, and business owners), we were able to transform the outdated experience and drive the future of finance forward. As a result, our app saw significant growth in 2021, with over 845,000 individuals and 18,200 companies using the app, and over 68,400 new customers onboarded.</p>

			<h2>Where's my Card: Real-time Delivery Tracking</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Client:</strong> Bancor - Finance and insurance
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Overview:</strong> The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the demand for traditional postal services hard. How can we reduce user anxiety while a country-wide quarantine extends card shipping delays?
			</p>
			<p>To address the challenges posed by the Covid restrictions and extended quarantine, our team worked closely with our postal service provider to develop solutions that would reduce user anxiety and alleviate shipping delays. We implemented a feature that allows regular credit and debit card users to track their parcel delivery directly from their homebanking app. This provides users with peace of mind and allows them to stay informed about the status of their delivery. Additionally, we enabled users to make transfers and payments using their debit and prepaid cards even if the physical card has not yet arrived. This allows users to continue accessing their funds and conducting transactions without having to wait for their physical card to arrive. Overall, these solutions have helped to improve the user experience and reduce anxiety for our customers during the pandemic.</p>

			<p>I conceptualized an e-commerce platform for searching, requesting, and paying for satellite images provided by these satellites.</p>
			<p>This new web app allows users to easily browse and purchase images from the SAOCOM 1A & B satellites, providing them with access to valuable information and insights about Earth's surface. This platform not only provides a convenient way for users to access and purchase satellite images but also helps to promote the use of these advanced satellite technologies.</p>

			<p>In order to streamline the onboarding process for Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeons, our team set out to consolidate the 112 different forms they were required to fill out.</p>
			<p> We began by iterating over multiple ideas for a conversational quoting tool, allowing surgeons to quickly and easily provide the necessary information. After conducting user testing and gathering feedback, we refined and improved the tool, creating a fast and compelling onboarding experience for surgeons. This streamlined process has improved the user experience and made it easier for surgeons to complete the onboarding process. </p>

			<h2>News in a Nutshell: The Media Clipping App</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Client:</strong> Infoxel - Media, Printing, and Publishing
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Overview:</strong> As politicians, journalists, and brand managers, staying on top of how your brand is being represented in the media can be a daunting task. With the constant flow of news and information, it can be difficult to keep track of every mention of your brand in TV, radio, and newspapers.
			</p>
			<p> To address this challenge, we decided to develop Vlic, a mobile app that would allow our users to quickly and easily see how their brand was being represented in the media as soon as news happened. With a team of skilled engineers, we set out to build a new media clipping product that would provide targeted information consumption and reduce the reliance on third-party applications. Thanks to our media clipping app, politicians, journalists, and brand managers are now able to stay on top of how their brand is being represented in the media, and make informed decisions about their public image. </p>
			<p>
				<strong>Key Features:</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Real-time notifications: Immediate notifications whenever the brand is mentioned in the media.</li>
				<li>Customizable feeds: Users can customize feeds to see news related to their specific brand.</li>
				<li>Easy sharing: Quick and easy sharing of news stories related to the brand with colleagues and followers. </li>
