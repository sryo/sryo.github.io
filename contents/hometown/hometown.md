## Overview

At HometownLocal, I led the **transformation of a simple demolition and construction rental web directory** into a full-fledged platform for home services. The driving question was: *What if we could make booking a home service as easy as ordering a ride?*

## The Challenge

The home service industry, particularly in demolition and construction, was ripe for disruption. Service providers were struggling with inefficient scheduling, communication gaps, and billing headaches. We saw an opportunity to **streamline these processes** and create an **Uber-like experience** for both service providers and homeowners.

## Our Solution

We developed a **comprehensive platform** that covers the entire service lifecycle, from **booking to billing**. Here's what we built:

## Key Features

- **Seamless Onboarding:** A smooth, intuitive process for both service providers and customers to join the platform.
- **Smart Booking Flow:** An AI-powered system that matches customer needs with the right service providers.
- **Multi-view Management Tools:**
  - Calendar view for easy scheduling
  - Kanban board for job status tracking
  - Map view for efficient route planning
- **Real-time Route Navigation:** Integrated GPS navigation to help service providers reach job sites efficiently.
- **Internal Messaging System:** A secure channel for clear communication between customers and service providers.
- **Automated Invoicing:** Streamlined billing process that triggers upon job completion.

## Development Journey

- Conducted extensive research into the pain points of both home service providers and customers.
- Rapidly prototyped and iterated on the UI/UX design, focusing on simplicity and efficiency.
- Collaborated closely with backend developers to ensure seamless integration of complex features like real-time scheduling and route optimization.

## Impact and Insights

The platform has transformed how home services are booked and managed in our target markets. Service providers report significant improvements in efficiency, with some seeing up to a 30% increase in completed jobs per week. Customers appreciate the transparency and ease of use, leading to higher satisfaction rates and repeat bookings.
