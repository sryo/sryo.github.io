## Overview

At HometownLocal, I led the redesign of a demolition and construction rental web directory into a platform for home services. The question we kept asking: could we make booking a home service as easy as ordering a ride?

## The challenge

The home service industry, especially demolition and construction, had real problems. Service providers dealt with messy scheduling, poor communication, and billing headaches. We wanted to fix these specific pain points for both providers and homeowners.

## Our solution

We built a platform that covers the entire service lifecycle, from booking to billing.

## Key features

- **Onboarding:** A straightforward process for service providers and customers to join.
- **Booking flow:** A matching system that connects customer needs with the right providers.
- **Management tools:**
  - Calendar view for scheduling
  - Kanban board for job status
  - Map view for route planning
- **Route navigation:** Integrated GPS to help providers reach job sites.
- **Messaging:** A channel for communication between customers and providers.
- **Invoicing:** Automated billing that triggers when jobs complete.

## Development journey

I researched the pain points of home service providers and their customers. We prototyped quickly and iterated on the design, focusing on simplicity. I worked closely with backend developers to integrate the scheduling and route optimization features.

## Impact

METRICS:
- **30%** increase in jobs completed per week
- **5** integrated service tools
- **100%** booking-to-billing automation
