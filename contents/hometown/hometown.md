## Overview

HometownLocal started as a web directory for demolition and construction rentals. It had traffic. People found providers, but the connection ended there. Scheduling, communication, and billing all happened outside the site.

We inserted ourselves into the middle. Instead of pointing users at providers and walking away, we built a platform that handled the transaction from booking through payment.

## Before and after

The old directory was a dead end. Users searched, clicked a phone number, and left. Providers got leads but no tools.

The new platform stays in the loop. Booking, scheduling, messaging, and invoicing all happen in one place. We gave providers a calendar, a Kanban board for job status, and route planning. We gave customers a single thread for each job. Every completed job triggers automatic billing.

## What I did

I researched pain points for providers and homeowners. Most complaints came down to the same thing: too many tools, none of them connected. We prototyped a unified flow and tested it with real providers. I worked with developers on scheduling logic and route optimization.

## Results

METRICS:
- **30%** increase in jobs completed per week
- **5** integrated tools (calendar, Kanban, maps, messaging, invoicing)
- **100%** booking-to-billing automation
