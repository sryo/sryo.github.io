## Overview

In March 2020, COVID-19 hit Argentina and Bancor's physical branches closed overnight. This cut off hundreds of thousands of customers from basic services. The government announced an emergency relief program (IFE) that would pay over 600,000 residents, many of whom had never had a bank account.

We worked around the clock. The goal was simple: get people their money. If we failed, families wouldn't eat.

## Objective

Digitize essential banking services and onboard hundreds of thousands of new users in days, not months.

## My role

I led Bancor's UX as the owner of Bancon, the home banking app. I designed the crisis features and built a new design system so that first-time digital users could actually use the platform.

## What we did

### Round-the-clock response

We had to rethink systems and cut anything non-essential. Years of digital progress needed to happen in a week.

Traditional onboarding was too slow. We worked with backend to create "logical accounts" for unbanked citizens without the usual paperwork. This let us open ~380,000 new accounts remotely.

I designed a feature to track credit card shipments and request delivery to a different address. Customers stuck in quarantine couldn't receive cards at their registered address.

### Peperina: the design system

I proposed and convinced management to fast-track a design system called Peperina. With 15 developers shipping features simultaneously under deadline pressure, we needed a way to keep the interface consistent without constant coordination.

Peperina provided reusable components across web and mobile. Developers could grab what they needed and build. The system held up because every component was tested and documented. When someone added a new screen, it looked like it belonged.

## Results

METRICS:
- **418%** increase in app transactions
- **680K** users (doubled from 360K)
- **380K+** new accounts created
- **81%** increase in pensioner usage

## Reflection

The urgency created a kind of bond in the team. We were exhausted but focused on one thing: getting relief to people who needed it. We chose speed over rigor, with calculated risks.

Once people were forced to try digital banking, many of them kept using it. Bancor jumped ahead in digital adoption by years.
