## Overview

In March 2020, as COVID-19 swept through Argentina, Bancor’s team faced an **unprecedented emergency**. Overnight, **physical branches closed**, cutting off hundreds of thousands of customers from essential services. The government’s new emergency relief program (IFE) meant over 600,000 residents needed to receive payments, many of whom were unbanked.

Inside Bancor, the atmosphere was intense. We were in "war room" mode, working round-the-clock. The mission was clear: **ensure these citizens could access their money quickly and safely**. Failure meant families going without essential funds.

## Objective

To rapidly **digitize essential banking services** and **onboard hundreds of thousands of new users** in a matter of days, not months.

## My Role

I **led Bancor's UX efforts** as the owner of Bancon, the home banking app. My role was to lead the design of **critical crisis features** and a **new design system**, ensuring that the sudden influx of first-time digital users could navigate the platform without confusion.

## Making Things Happen

### The "War Room" Response
We had to **rethink systems and prioritize ruthlessly**. **Years of digital progress needed to happen in a week**.

- **Rapid Onboarding:** Traditional onboarding was too slow. We worked on a modified backend system to create “logical accounts” for unbanked citizens without the usual paperwork. This allowed ~380,000 new accounts to be opened remotely.
- **Project "Peperina":** I proposed and convinced management to fast-track a new design system, code-named “Peperina,” to unify the look and feel of Bancor’s web and mobile platforms. We built a library of reusable components that ensured consistency under intense deadlines.
- **Crisis Features:** I designed a new feature to track credit card shipments and request delivery to a different address, a crucial solution for customers unable to receive cards at their registered address due to quarantine.

## Results

The transformation fundamentally reset the bank's trajectory:

METRICS:
- **418%** increase in app transactions
- **680K** users (doubled from 360K)
- **380K+** new accounts created
- **81%** increase in pensioner usage

## Reflection

The urgency of the crisis forged an emotional bond within the team, defined by exhaustion, determination, and a singular focus on delivering relief. It was a **classic speed vs. rigor dilemma**, and we **chose speed, with controlled risk**.

This experience proved that once forced to try digital banking, many customers embraced it. Bancor effectively leap-frogged ahead in digital adoption, reaching usage levels it might have otherwise taken years to achieve.
