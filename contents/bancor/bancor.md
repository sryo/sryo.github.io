# Bancor: Where's My Card?

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, I led a project at Bancor to address a critical question: *How can we alleviate user anxiety when card deliveries are delayed due to nationwide quarantine?* This project was born from the urgent need to adapt our services to the unprecedented challenges posed by the pandemic.

## The Challenge

The COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted traditional postal services, leading to significant delays in credit and debit card deliveries. This situation caused considerable anxiety among our customers, who were uncertain about when they would receive their cards and how they could access their funds in the meantime.

## Our Solution

We developed a two-pronged approach to address this challenge:

1. Real-time Card Tracking
2. Virtual Card Activation

## Key Features

- **In-App Delivery Tracking:** Integrated real-time parcel tracking directly into the Bancor mobile app.
- **Push Notifications:** Automatic updates on card status and estimated delivery dates.
- **Virtual Card Activation:** Ability to use debit or prepaid cards for transfers and payments before physical card arrival.

## Development Journey

- Collaborated closely with our postal service provider to integrate their tracking API into our app.
- Designed and implemented a user-friendly interface for tracking information, focusing on clarity and reassurance.
- Worked with our security team to develop robust verification processes for virtual card activation.
- Conducted rapid user testing to ensure the new features effectively reduced anxiety and improved user experience.

## Impact and Insights

The implementation of these features significantly reduced customer support calls related to card deliveries. Users reported feeling more in control and less anxious about their banking services during the pandemic. The virtual card activation feature, in particular, proved so popular that it has become a permanent offering, even as delivery delays have normalized.
