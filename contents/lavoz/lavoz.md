## Overview

By the mid-2010s, *La Voz del Interior*, a 115-year-old Argentine newspaper, faced a critical challenge. While online readership was surging, **print advertising revenue had plummeted** by 40%. The "**digital business**" had to become the **primary revenue source**, but monetizing an audience used to free content seemed impossible.

The fear of losing audience was palpable. Even major papers delayed implementing paywalls. But with ad revenues stagnant, we recognized that a new business model wasn't optional; it was essential.

## Objective

To **modernize the product for a mobile-first audience** and **build a sustainable subscription model** (paywall) in a market resistant to paying for news.

## My Role

I joined the team to **lead this transformation**, **balancing user needs with business survival**. I worked with an interdisciplinary team, editorial leaders, developers, marketing analysts, to design and implement a mobile-first strategy and a custom paywall solution.

## Making Things Happen

### Embracing Mobile-First Storytelling
Younger readers were on Instagram and WhatsApp, not reading long broadsheets. We had to meet them on their turf.
- **Visual Storytelling:** We **shifted from text-heavy articles to "snackable" content**, rich with photos, videos, and infographics optimized for thumb-scrolling.
- **Clean Design:** We rolled out a fresh, minimalist interface that put content first, removing the clutter that drove mobile users away.

### Building "Wyleex" (The Paywall)
The most daring move was the paywall. Commercial solutions were too expensive (priced in dollars) for the Argentine economy.
- **Build vs. Buy:** We decided to **build our own paywall platform**. It was a **risky choice**, essentially opting to act like a tech company.
- **Research-Driven:** I led the research to understand what content readers would pay for. We benchmarked global models and designed a flexible system that fit our local reality.
- **The Launch:** In February 2018, we launched. It was a momentous step.

## Results

The transformation turned a traditional print outlet into a digital-forward media company:

METRICS:
- **23.5K** paying subscribers in 2 years
- **10K** subscribers in first 6 months
- **Top 10** global recognition by Editor & Publisher

## Reflection

This project was about more than just technology; it was about **culture change**. We had to convince a newsroom steeped in tradition to **embrace a new way of telling stories**. The success of Wyleex, which we later offered as a service to other publishers in Latin America, proved that local solutions could compete on a global stage.
