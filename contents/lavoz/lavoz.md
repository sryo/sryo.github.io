## Overview

By the mid-2010s, *La Voz del Interior*, a 115-year-old Argentine newspaper, was in trouble. Online readership was growing, but **print advertising revenue had dropped** by 40%. The "**digital business**" needed to become the **primary revenue source**, but the audience expected news to be free.

Other papers were hesitant to add paywalls. We decided to try anyway.

## Objective

To **redesign the product for mobile readers** and **build a subscription model** (paywall) in a market where people weren't used to paying for news.

## My role

I joined the team to **lead this work**, **balancing user needs with business reality**. I worked with an interdisciplinary team—editorial leaders, developers, marketing analysts—to design and implement a mobile-first strategy and a custom paywall solution.

## Making things happen

### Mobile-first storytelling
Younger readers were on Instagram and WhatsApp, not reading long broadsheets. We had to meet them where they were.
- **Visual storytelling:** I **shifted the approach from text-heavy articles to "snackable" content**, rich with photos, videos, and infographics optimized for thumb-scrolling.
- **Clean design:** We rolled out a minimalist interface that put content first, removing the clutter that drove mobile users away.

### Building "Wyleex" (the paywall)
Commercial paywall solutions were priced in dollars—too expensive for the Argentine economy.
- **Build vs. buy:** We decided to **build our own paywall platform**. It was **risky**, essentially choosing to act like a tech company.
- **Research-driven:** I led the research to understand what content readers would actually pay for. We benchmarked global models and designed a flexible system that fit our local market.
- **The launch:** In February 2018, we went live.

## Results

The project turned a traditional print outlet into a digital-forward media company:

METRICS:
- **23.5K** paying subscribers in 2 years
- **10K** subscribers in first 6 months
- **Top 10** global recognition by Editor & Publisher

## Reflection

This project required convincing a newsroom steeped in tradition to tell stories differently. The paywall worked. We later offered Wyleex as a service to other publishers in Latin America.
