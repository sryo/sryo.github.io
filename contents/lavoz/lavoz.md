## Overview

By the mid-2010s, *La Voz del Interior*, a 115-year-old Argentine newspaper, was in trouble. Online readership was growing, but print advertising revenue had dropped by 40%. The digital business needed to become the primary revenue source, but the audience expected news to be free.

Other papers were hesitant to add paywalls. We decided to try anyway.

## Build decision

We built our own paywall platform, Wyleex.

The core components:
- Metering logic that tracks article consumption per user
- Content tiers separating free, premium, and exclusive stories
- Subscription management integrated with local payment processors

Building in-house meant we controlled the pricing model. We could offer peso-denominated subscriptions and adjust tiers based on what Argentine readers would actually pay.

## Mobile-first storytelling

Younger readers were on Instagram and WhatsApp, not reading long broadsheets. We had to meet them where they were.
- **Visual storytelling:** I shifted the approach from text-heavy articles to "snackable" content, rich with photos, videos, and infographics optimized for thumb-scrolling.
- **Clean design:** We rolled out a minimalist interface that put content first, removing the clutter that drove mobile users away.

## Results

In February 2018, the paywall went live.

METRICS:
- **23.5K** paying subscribers in 2 years
- **10K** subscribers in first 6 months
- **Top 10** global recognition by Editor & Publisher

This project required convincing a newsroom steeped in tradition to tell stories differently. The paywall worked. We later offered Wyleex as a service to other publishers in Latin America.
