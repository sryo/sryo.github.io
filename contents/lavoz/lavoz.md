# A Newspaper's Digital Transformation: Reinventing the news for the digital age

## The Context

By the mid-2010s, La Voz del Interior, a 115-year-old Argentine newspaper, faced a critical challenge. While its online readership surged, print advertising revenue had plummeted by 40% since 2010, and digital ads—dominated by tech giants like Google and Facebook—couldn’t fill the gap. Younger audiences (90% of Argentine adults aged 18–39) now consumed news on smartphones, expecting fast, visual, and social-friendly content. Yet, the newspaper’s digital experience lagged: the website felt cluttered, text-heavy, and slow on mobile, driving casual readers away. Worse, monetizing this audience seemed impossible in a culture resistant to paying for news. How do you ask readers to pay for news in a culture used to free online content? Even major papers delayed implementing paywalls for fear of driving the audience away – “the fear of losing audience… was very present,” one editor admitted in hindsight. But with ad revenues stagnant and print circulation steadily declining, La Voz recognized that a new business model was not optional; it was essential. In June 2017 I joined the team to lead this transformation, balancing user needs with business survival.

## Making Things Happen
The strategy focused on two pillars: mobile-first storytelling and a sustainable paywall model.

### Embracing Mobile-First Storytelling
Younger readers were spending more time on Instagram, Snapchat, and WhatsApp than on traditional news sites. We knew we had to meet these readers on their turf – the smartphone – and speak the visual language they craved. We experimented with image-rich articles, short videos, and even interactive “stories” style posts optimized for thumb-scrolling. Instead of retrofitting content for smaller screens, La Voz began designing for mobile from the start, ensuring stories would be easy to consume on the go. This meant rethinking layouts, speed, and storytelling techniques with the smartphone user at the center of every decision. We rolled out a fresh, minimalist interface that put content first. Key changes included:
Clean, Clutter-Free Pages: A sleek layout with minimal visual noise for easier reading on small screens
Mobile-Optimized Typography: Larger, legible sans-serif fonts for titles and body text, boosting readability on handheld devices​
Streamlined Navigation.

“Embracing mobile-first” wasn’t just about layout – it meant reimagining storytelling itself. La Voz transitioned from relying purely on long-form text articles to crafting visually rich, snackable content ideal for scrolling. Journalists were encouraged to leverage photos, infographics, and short videos to tell stories at a glance. The newsroom even ramped up real-time coverage: reporters publish quick updates and breaking news bytes that fit naturally into a mobile feed.
Early on, the site’s registered user base began climbing, a sign of growing loyal readers. (In fact, within months of a later initiative, registered user accounts jumped to 520,000, growing by ~7,000 per month).

### Building a Sustainable Paywall Model
The most daring move in La Voz del Interior’s transformation was implementing a digital subscription (paywall) strategy. This was a make-or-break initiative – one that many inside the company knew was critical for long-term sustainability, yet it was fraught with risk. The memories of early experiments lingered (in Argentina, even the biggest papers waited until 2017 to charge for online news, fearful of traffic drops), but by 2017 La Voz had little choice. Print revenues were declining relentlessly, and digital ads alone couldn’t secure the future. As Carlos Jornet, La Voz’s director, put it, we realized the “digital business” had to become the primary revenue source within a few years. The question was how to do it right. Instead of rushing in, we methodically planned our paywall – treating it as both a technical project and a business strategy. I was part of an interdisciplinary team bringing together editorial leaders, developers, marketing analysts, and customer service reps to cover all angles. This team’s first task was research: How likely were La Voz readers to pay? What content would they pay for? What pricing would work in the local market? After extensive market surveys and usability tests, gathering qualitative and quantitative data on audience preferences, identifying segments of loyal readers, casual visitors, content categories, demographics, and devices used.Armed with this data, I benchmarked what other news organizations were doing. We studied various paywall models – hard walls, metered (pay after X free articles), freemium models with exclusive content, etc. – and examined pricing strategies in Argentina and internationally. We confronted a practical hurdle: the available commercial paywall solutions were very expensive (priced in US dollars, with long contracts) and not designed for the Latin American market realities.Since the late 2010s, prolonged inflation remained a constant problem of economy of Argentina, with an annual rate of 25% in 2017, second only to Venezuela in South America and the highest in the G20. This threatened to derail the project – an out-of-the-box system would have raised costs by 40%, suddenly making the whole plan financially unfeasible. We decided to build our own paywall platform. It was a risky choice, essentially opting to act like a tech company. I got to work with in-house developers, and drawing on my research, designed a custom subscription system eventually known as Wyleex. In February 2018, La Voz del Interior launched its digital subscriptions – a momentous step in the paper’s history. La Voz reached its entire first-year subscription goal in just the second month after launch. Within six months, over 10,000 digital subscriptions had been sold, a number that catapulted La Voz into the top ranks globally for growth in digital news subscribers. (In fact, an international report noted that such a figure would place La Voz among the world’s 50 leading news outlets by digital subscriber. Recognizing that many peers in Latin America faced the same hurdles (high cost of paywall tech, need for a local solution), we offered "Wyleex" to other publishers as a service. It was quickly adopted by news organizations in Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, Panama, and beyond, creating a new revenue stream for La Voz and earning the company recognition as a digital thought leader.

## Laying a Foundation for the Future
In just a few years, La Voz del Interior’s digital transformation produced tangible, data-backed results. Audience engagement hit new highs: the mobile-friendly approach and UX revamps led to longer session times and more frequent visits, especially among the coveted younger demographic.

From zero digital subscribers in 2017, La Voz grew to 10,000+ in 6 months, 23,500 in 2 years, and continued climbing thereafter. Each of those subscribers represents recurring revenue in a business that once relied solely on the ebb and flow of advertising and newsstand sales.
In 2019, our paywall initiative was a finalist for WAN-IFRA’s Digital Media LATAM Awards in the “Best Paid Content Strategy” category, and in 2020 Editor & Publisher magazine named La Voz del Interior one of the “10 News Publishers That Do It Right” globally.
La Voz del Interior has transformed from a traditional print outlet into a digital-forward media company.
