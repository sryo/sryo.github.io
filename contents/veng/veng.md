## Overview

At VENG, I led the concept work for an e-commerce platform selling satellite imagery. The starting question was simple: what if buying a satellite image was as easy as buying a book online?

## The challenge

SAOCOM is a constellation of two high-resolution satellites that can observe Earth's surface 24/7, regardless of weather. But getting this data meant working through specialized organizations and complicated request processes. Most people who could use these images—researchers, planners, analysts—had no practical way to access them.

## What we built

An e-commerce platform where users search, request, and purchase images from the SAOCOM 1A and B satellites.

The interface includes a map for selecting areas of interest, filters for date and resolution, low-resolution previews before purchase, a system for requesting images of areas not in the catalog, and payment integration.

## How we worked

I collaborated with the VENG team to understand the satellites' capabilities and constraints. The main design challenge was making complex satellite data usable for people without a remote sensing background.

## Impact

METRICS:
- **2** SAOCOM satellites integrated
- **24/7** all-weather imaging access
- **New markets** opened for researchers and planners

The platform brought satellite imagery to environmental researchers, urban planners, and others who previously couldn't access it directly.
