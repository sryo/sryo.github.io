## Overview

VENG operates the SAOCOM satellites, a constellation that captures Earth imagery around the clock in any weather. Getting that data meant going through agencies and paperwork. Researchers and analysts who could use the images rarely had access.

We built an e-commerce platform to change that. Users browse a map, filter by date and resolution, preview images, and pay online. For areas not in the catalog, they can submit a tasking request for new captures.

## What we shipped

This was a working product, not a prototype. Users could:

- Search an archive by location, date, and cloud cover
- Preview low-resolution imagery before purchase
- Buy and download high-resolution files
- Request new satellite passes for custom areas

I worked with the VENG team to understand the satellites' technical constraints and translated those into interface decisions. SAR imagery is unfamiliar to most users, so the design leaned on familiar e-commerce patterns: search, preview, add to cart, checkout.

## Results

METRICS:
- **2** SAOCOM satellites integrated
- **24/7** all-weather imaging access
- New buyer segments: environmental researchers, urban planners, agri-tech firms
