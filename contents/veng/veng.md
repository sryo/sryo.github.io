# VENG: A New Perspective on Earth

At VENG, I led the conceptualization of an e-commerce platform for satellite imagery, driven by the question: *What if accessing high-resolution satellite images was as easy as buying a book online?* This project aimed to democratize access to advanced satellite technology and Earth observation data.

## The Challenge

SAOCOM, a constellation of two high-resolution satellites, can observe Earth's surface 24/7, regardless of weather conditions. However, accessing this valuable data was complex and often restricted to specialized organizations. We saw an opportunity to make this technology accessible to a broader audience.

## Our Solution

We developed an intuitive e-commerce platform that allows users to search, request, and purchase satellite images from the SAOCOM 1A & B satellites.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Map Interface:** Users can visually select areas of interest on a global map.
- **Advanced Search Filters:** Options to filter images by date, weather conditions, resolution, and more.
- **Image Preview:** Low-resolution previews of available images before purchase.
- **Custom Request System:** Users can request images of specific areas not currently in the catalog.
- **Secure Payment Gateway:** Integration with multiple payment methods for easy transactions.
- **Download Manager:** Efficient delivery of large image files to users.
- **Usage Rights Management:** Clear explanation and management of image usage rights.

## Development Journey

- Collaborated with satellite engineers to understand the capabilities and limitations of the SAOCOM satellites.
- Designed an intuitive UI that simplifies complex satellite data for non-expert users.
- Implemented a robust backend capable of handling large image files and complex search queries.
- Developed a pricing algorithm that balances accessibility with the high costs of satellite operation.

## Impact and Insights

The platform has opened up new markets for satellite imagery, from environmental researchers to urban planners and even artists. We've seen a significant increase in the use of SAOCOM data across various fields, contributing to advancements in climate research, agriculture, and urban development.

Some of my favorite touches:
- The "Earth Diary" feature that shows users how their area of interest has changed over time.
- The satisfying "capture" animation that plays when a user requests a new image.
- The "resolution comparison" tool that visually demonstrates the power of SAOCOM's imaging capabilities.
