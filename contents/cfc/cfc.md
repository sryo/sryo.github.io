# Continental Finance: Banking as a Game
At Continental Finance, I led the development of a gamified banking experience, tackling a crucial question: How can we make improving credit scores both engaging and educational? This project sought to support the 48 million Americans with poor credit by helping them grow their credit lines and understand why it's important.

## The Challenge
For those with poor credit scores or no credit history, qualifying for a credit card can be a daunting task. Traditional banking apps often fail to motivate users to improve their financial health. We needed to find a way to not only help users grow their credit line but also guide them in understanding the significance of maintaining a good credit score.

## Our Solution
We created a gamified banking app that transforms the process of improving credit scores into an interactive and rewarding experience, blending financial education with motivational incentives.

## Key Features
- **Achievement Badges:** Visual rewards that celebrate users’ financial milestones.
- **Interactive Credit Lessons:** Engaging, bite-sized lessons on credit management and personal finance.
- **Spending Insights:** Actionable insights into users’ spending habits, promoting smarter financial decisions.

## Development Journey
- Conducted thorough research on gamification principles and their application to financial contexts.
- Partnered with financial experts to ensure that the app’s educational content was accurate and impactful.
- Designed an intuitive and visually appealing UI to make financial concepts approachable and less intimidating.
