## Overview

TopicFlower started as a **visualization tool** that displayed social media topics as a "flower." Each petal represented a topic, sized by engagement. It looked good and helped brands see what resonated.

But as the market matured, **looking good wasn't enough**. Brands **wanted deeper analytics and actionable insights**. The flower was a great conversation starter, but data-driven teams needed more.

## Objective

To **transform a visual novelty into an analytics platform** without losing the identity that made TopicFlower distinctive.

## My role

I was brought in to **redesign the app's usability and product strategy**. My job was to **connect** the visual model to the hard data that social media managers needed to prove ROI.

## Making things happen

### From art to analytics
Early TopicFlower was all form, little function. Users struggled to extract concrete numbers from the flower model.
- **The redesign:** We introduced a new dashboard that **prioritized metrics**. We answered the "Who, What, When, Where" of engagement immediately, using the flower as a supporting visual rather than the only interface.
- **Actionable features:** We added a content calendar and scheduling tools. This shifted the platform from a place you *checked* to a **place you *worked***.
- **Competitive benchmarking:** We built tools to compare performance against competitors, turning interaction data into strategic guidance.

### Tech and implementation
Upgrading from a visual tool to a platform required a major overhaul. We used the Nebular Design System (Angular) to build a consistent, modern interface. I worked closely with developers to make the new data visualizations performant and responsive.

## Results

METRICS:
- **19** countries reached
- **5+** Fortune 500 clients
- **100%** shift from visualization to strategy tool

## Reflection

The flower visualization still works as a hook, but now there's real analysis underneath it. Teams can actually make decisions based on the data, not just admire it.
