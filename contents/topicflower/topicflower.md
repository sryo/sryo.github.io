## Overview

TopicFlower began as a **unique visualization tool** that displayed social media topics as a "flower." Each petal represented a topic, sized by engagement. It was **visually stunning** and helped brands see what resonated.

But as the market matured, **"pretty" wasn't enough**. Brands **demanded deeper analytics and actionable insights**. The flower was a great conversation starter, but it wasn't closing the deal for data-driven teams.

## Objective

To **transform a visual novelty into a robust, decision-driving analytics platform** without losing the unique identity that made TopicFlower special.

## My Role

I was brought in to **redesign the app’s usability and product strategy**. My mission was to **bridge the gap** between the visual model and the hard data that social media managers needed to prove ROI.

## Making Things Happen

### From Art to Analytics
Early TopicFlower was all form, little function. Users struggled to extract concrete numbers from the flower model.
- **The Redesign:** We introduced a new dashboard that **prioritized metrics**. We answered the "Who, What, When, Where" of engagement immediately, using the flower as a supporting visual rather than the only interface.
- **Actionable Features:** We added a content calendar and scheduling tools. This shifted the platform from a place you *checked* to a **place you *worked***.
- **Competitive Benchmarking:** We built tools to compare performance against competitors, turning interaction data into strategic guidance.

### Tech & Implementation
Upgrading from a visual tool to a platform required a major overhaul. We utilized the Nebular Design System (Angular) to build a consistent, modern interface. I worked closely with developers to ensure the new complex data visualizations were performant and responsive.

## Results

- **Global Expansion:** Grew presence to 19 countries.
- **Major Client Acquisition:** Attracted enterprise clients like IBM, Movistar, Starbucks, BBVA, and Mercedes-Benz.
- **Strategic Value:** Shifted the value proposition from "seeing your topics" to "driving your strategy."

## Reflection

What was once just a pretty visualization evolved into a **decision-driving platform**. The redesign reinforced TopicFlower’s role as an innovative social insights platform, proving that you **don't have to sacrifice beauty for utility**, you just have to make sure the utility is there.
