## Overview

TopicFlower displayed social media topics as a flower. Each petal represented a topic, sized by engagement. Clients liked the visual, but "that's cool" doesn't renew contracts.

As the market matured, brands wanted numbers they could act on. The flower was a conversation starter. Data-driven teams needed more.

## Objective

Transform a visual novelty into an analytics platform without losing the identity that made TopicFlower distinctive.

## My role

I redesigned the app's usability and product strategy. The task was to connect the visual model to the hard data that social media managers needed to prove ROI.

## The shift from art to analytics

Early TopicFlower was all form, little function. Users struggled to extract concrete numbers from the flower model.

The redesign introduced a dashboard that prioritized metrics. We answered the "Who, What, When, Where" of engagement immediately. The flower became a supporting visual rather than the only interface.

We added a content calendar and scheduling tools. This shifted the platform from a place you checked to a place you worked. We also built competitive benchmarking to compare performance against competitors, turning interaction data into strategic guidance.

## Tech and implementation

Upgrading from a visual tool to a platform required a major overhaul. We used the Nebular Design System (Angular) to build a consistent interface. I worked closely with developers to make the new data visualizations performant and responsive.

## Results

METRICS:
- **19** countries reached
- **5+** Fortune 500 clients
- **100%** shift from visualization to strategy tool

## Reflection

The flower visualization still works as a hook, but now there's real analysis underneath it. Teams can make decisions based on the data, not just admire it.
