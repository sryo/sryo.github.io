## Overview

Infoxel Media Labs ran a 24/7 archive of media broadcasts for ad tracking. The system captured everything, but all that data just sat in expensive storage.

I came in as a Product Designer to figure out what else we could do with it. Could this archive become something more than an ad-tracking tool?

## My role

I explored new product ideas on a weekly basis, prototyping and testing concepts that used the existing data. I led the internal "hackathon" sessions that produced our new product suite.

## What we built

### Vlic: real-time news monitoring

PR teams were learning about crises hours after they aired. Traditional monitoring was too slow.

We started with web dashboards, but they weren't immediate enough. User interviews pointed us toward mobile push notifications. The final app pinged users the instant their keyword was mentioned on TV or radio, so they could react while the story was still developing.

### Welo: live TV clipping

Newsrooms had to wait for engineers to pull footage, often missing the window for viral moments.

We built a "live DVR" with a timeline interface. Users dragged handles to set start and end points on a live stream. Server-side video processing made it feel instant on the phone. Each week, we invited journalists to try it. Their feedback helped us cut the time from "clip" to "tweet" down to seconds.

## Results

METRICS:
- **2** new products launched (Vlic, Welo)
- **Real-time** monitoring vs day-after
- **#1** in LatAm media intelligence

## Reflection

Running weekly hackathons let us go from idea to validated prototype in days. We tested features quickly and dropped the ones that didn't work. The approach became how the company tried new ideas going forward.
