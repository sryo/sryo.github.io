## Overview

Infoxel Media Labs was sitting on a goldmine: a **massive, 24/7 archive of media broadcasts** used for ad tracking. But this "always-on" capture system was just a **cost center**, expensive storage for data that wasn't being fully used.

The challenge emerged: How could we repurpose this vast media corpus into new, impactful products? We needed to find value beyond simple ad tracking.

## Objective

To **transform a passive media archive into active, real-time intelligence tools** for journalists, political analysts, and PR teams.

## My Role

I joined as a Product Designer tasked with answering that question. My role was to **explore new ideas on a weekly basis**, **rapidly prototyping and testing** concepts that leveraged the data. I led the "hackathon" culture that birthed our new product suite.

## Making Things Happen

### Vlic: Real-Time News Monitoring
Traditional monitoring was too slow. PR pros learned about crises hours after they aired.
- **The Pivot:** We needed to **flip monitoring from a passive, day-after email to an active, moment-by-moment awareness tool**.
- **Experimentation:** We started with web dashboards, but they weren't immediate enough. Through user interviews, we realized mobile push notifications were the key.
- **The Result:** We built an app that pinged users the instant their keyword was mentioned on TV or radio, allowing them to react in real-time.

### Welo: Live TV Clipping
Capturing live TV was hard. Newsrooms had to wait for engineers to pull footage, missing the viral moment.
- **The Idea:** A "**live DVR**" for everyone.
- **The Prototype:** We built a timeline interface that let users drag handles to set start and end points on a live stream. All the heavy video processing happened on the server, making it feel instant on the phone.
- **Iteration:** Each week, we invited journalists to try it. Their feedback helped us streamline the process from "clip" to "tweet" down to seconds.

## Results

- **New Revenue Streams:** Transformed a cost center (storage) into a profit center by creating high-value services.
- **Market Leadership:** Positioned Infoxel (now Seenka) as an early mover in real-time media intelligence in Latin America.
- **Cultural Shift:** Established a culture of rapid experimentation and user-centric design within the company.

## Reflection

The process behind these products became a **template for innovation** at the company. By running weekly "hackathons," we proved the value of **lean product design**, going from idea to validated prototype in days. This approach de-risked bold ideas and surfaced the features that truly mattered.
