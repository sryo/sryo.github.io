## Overview

Infoxel Media Labs ran a 24/7 archive of TV and radio broadcasts. The data existed for one purpose: verifying that ads actually aired. Expensive storage, a single use case.

I came in to ask what else we could do with the archive. If we already had the infrastructure to capture, store, and search broadcast media, what other products could come out of it?

## My role

I explored new product ideas on a weekly basis, prototyping and testing concepts that used the existing data. I led the internal "hackathon" sessions that produced our new product suite.

## What we built

### Vlic: real-time news monitoring

PR teams were learning about crises hours after they aired. Traditional monitoring was too slow.

We started with web dashboards, but they weren't immediate enough. User interviews pointed us toward mobile push notifications. The final app pinged users the instant their keyword was mentioned on TV or radio, so they could react while the story was still developing.

### Welo: live TV clipping

Newsrooms waited on engineers to pull footage. By the time they got clips, the window for social sharing had closed.

We built a live DVR interface. Users dragged handles on a timeline to mark start and end points, then exported clips to share. Server-side processing kept the phone-side experience fast. Weekly sessions with journalists helped us cut export time to seconds.

## Results

METRICS:
- **2** new products launched (Vlic, Welo)
- Real-time monitoring vs day-after reporting
- **#1** in LatAm media intelligence

Weekly prototyping sessions let us move from idea to test in days. We dropped features that did not work and doubled down on the ones that did. The approach became the company's standard for trying new ideas.
