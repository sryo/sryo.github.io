# Bancón: Reimagining Banking for the Digital Age

In 2021, I led the UX design for Bancón at Bancor, driven by a fundamental question: *How can we make banking as intuitive as using a virtual wallet?* This project was born from the realization that traditional banking apps were losing ground to more user-friendly fintech solutions.

## The Challenge

According to Veritran, 7 out of 10 users in Argentina prefer digital transactions through virtual wallets over traditional banking apps. Additionally, 3 out of 10 still visit physical branches for major transactions. Our mission was clear: transform an antiquated industry through User-Centered Design and drive the future of finance forward.

## Our Approach

We implemented a user-centered design approach to modernize Bancor's mobile app. Our goal was to create an experience that was easily navigated by each of the bank's key audiences:

- Older adults
- Public employees
- Students
- Business owners

## Key Features

- **Intuitive Interface:** Redesigned UI that mimics the simplicity of popular virtual wallets.
- **Smart Categorization:** Transactions automatically sorted and categorized for easy financial management.
- **Personalized Insights:** AI-driven financial advice tailored to each user's spending habits and goals.
- **Seamless Transfers:** One-tap transfers to frequently used contacts, rivaling the ease of peer-to-peer payment apps.
- **Virtual Assistant:** An AI chatbot to guide users through complex banking operations.

## Development Journey

- Conducted extensive user research to understand the pain points of different user groups.
- Created and tested multiple prototypes, iterating based on user feedback.
- Collaborated closely with backend developers to ensure the feasibility of new features.
- Implemented accessibility features to make the app usable for all, regardless of ability.

## Impact and Results

The reimagined Bancón app saw significant growth in 2021:

- Over 845,000 individual users
- 18,200 companies actively using the app
- 68,400 new customers onboarded

These numbers not only validated our user-centric approach but also demonstrated that traditional banks can compete with fintech startups when they prioritize user experience.

Some of my favorite touches:
- The "financial health score" feature that gamifies good financial habits.
- The subtle haptic feedback when completing a transaction, providing a sense of security.
- The "branch finder" that uses AR to guide users to the nearest physical bank when needed.
