# Vlic: News in a Nutshell

I led the development of Vlic at Infoxel, driven by a pressing question: *What if brand managers could instantly know how they're perceived in the media?* This project emerged from the realization that in our fast-paced media landscape, staying informed is both crucial and increasingly challenging.

## The Challenge

Politicians, journalists, and brand managers face a daunting task: keeping track of their brand's representation across TV, radio, and newspapers. The constant flow of information makes it easy to miss critical mentions or emerging trends.

## Our Solution

We created Vlic, a mobile app that revolutionizes media monitoring. It's not just a news aggregator; it's a real-time brand perception tool that puts the power of media analysis in your pocket.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Notifications:** Instant alerts when your brand is mentioned, allowing for rapid response to emerging stories.
- **Customizable Feeds:** Tailored news streams that focus on your specific brand or areas of interest.
- **One-tap Sharing:** Quickly disseminate relevant news to your team or followers, fostering collaborative media management.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** AI-powered insights into the tone and context of brand mentions.
- **Historical Trends:** Track your brand's media presence over time, identifying patterns and areas for improvement.

## Development Journey

- Collaborated with a team of skilled engineers to build a robust backend capable of processing vast amounts of media data in real-time.
- Designed an intuitive UI that presents complex media data in an easily digestible format.
- Implemented machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of brand mention detection and sentiment analysis over time.

## Impact and Insights

Vlic has transformed how professionals interact with media. It's not just about staying informed; it's about gaining a competitive edge through timely, actionable insights. The app has been particularly embraced by political campaign managers and PR professionals, who've reported making faster, more informed decisions about their public image strategies.

Some of my favorite touches:
- The "media pulse" feature that visualizes the frequency and sentiment of brand mentions over the past 24 hours.
- The satisfying "ping" sound when a high-priority mention is detected, distinct from regular notifications.
- The "reaction time" metric that gamifies how quickly users respond to significant media mentions.
