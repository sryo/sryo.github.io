Córdoba's bus system has an official tracker called TuBondi. It works, but the interface feels like it was designed by committee in 2012. I kept thinking: what if checking when my bus arrives was actually pleasant?

[Subí](https://github.com/sryo/Subi) ("get on" in Argentine Spanish) is an alternative frontend that pulls from the same data but presents it differently. Real-time arrivals, a cleaner map, and a schematic view that turns spaghetti routes into something readable.
