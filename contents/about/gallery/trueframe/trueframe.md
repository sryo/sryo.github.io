In Spanish, "recordar" (to remember) comes from "re-cordis", to pass through the heart again. Trueframe takes that literally.

Hold your phone to your chest and cover the proximity sensor. The app starts capturing photos automatically, a burst of moments while you're present in the scene instead of behind a screen. When you lower the phone, it analyzes the shots using Vision framework and keeps only the good ones. The filter isn't a feature. It's permission to not worry. Blurry frames, closed eyes, bad lighting, filtered out before they hit your camera roll.

There's something different about photos taken this way. You're not framing, not adjusting, not performing. The camera catches whatever was actually happening while you were busy being there.
