#### What if touchpads typed?

This month, I've been tinkering with my digital workspace. I started wondering: what if my touchpad worked as a keyboard? From this thought, [TrackpadWizard](https://github.com/sryo/Spoons/blob/main/TrackpadWizard.lua) was born. It's still a work in progress, but I'm happy with what I've accomplished so far. In addition, I created [HyperlinkHijacker](https://github.com/sryo/Spoons/blob/main/HyperlinkHijacker.lua), a no-fuss tool to control your hyperlink destinations. Click a link, and you get a list of browsers/profiles to choose from.
