While looking for ways in which we could bring real data into our designs I found a Figma plugin called Google sheets sync, which pretty much does what it says. It allows you to sync data in a google sheet with specific layers in your designs, but it lacks a way to import working clickable links.

On a hack day, I decided to create [Anchorify](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1284214046492867185/anchorify), a Figma Plugin for converting `[text](url)` and `[url=url]text[/url]` links into clickable hyperlinks.

Another plugin, [Word Hugger](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1285425464785405153/word-hugger), refines text elements with isolated words, known as "orphans," ensuring a polished paragraph layout by grouping together the last couple of words. Because every word deserves company.
