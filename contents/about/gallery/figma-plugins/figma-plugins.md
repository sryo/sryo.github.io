While looking for ways in which we could bring real data into our designs I found a Figma plugin called Google sheets sync, which pretty much does what it says. It allows you to **sync data in a google sheet** with specific layers in your designs, but it lacks a way to **import working clickable links**.

On a hack day, I decided to create [Anchorify](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1284214046492867185/anchorify), a Figma Plugin for **converting `&#91;text&#93;(url)` and `[url=url]text[/url]` links into clickable hyperlinks**.

Another plugin, [Word Hugger](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1285425464785405153/word-hugger), **fixes orphaned words** (those lonely single words on a line) by grouping together the last couple of words. Because every word deserves company.
