In July 2023, I built [ChronoMouse](https://sryo.github.io/ChronoMouse/), a tool to **keep track of time right beside the cursor**.

I kept losing track of time while working, so I made a thing that shows it where I'm already looking. Learning Swift along the way meant I could **go from idea to finished app myself**.
