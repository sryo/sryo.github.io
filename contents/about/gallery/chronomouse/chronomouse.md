#### What if cursors told the time?

In July 2023, I brought a personal idea to life by building [ChronoMouse](https://github.com/sryo/ChronoMouse), a tool to keep track of time right beside the cursor. This project was more than just a coding exercise; it was a realization of a concept that came from recognizing a need in my own workflow. Learning to program in Swift allowed me to take control of the entire process, from the initial idea to the finished product, reinforcing the power of integrating design and development skills.
