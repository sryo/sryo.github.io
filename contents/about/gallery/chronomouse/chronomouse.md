In July 2023, I brought a personal idea to life by building [ChronoMouse](https://github.com/sryo/ChronoMouse), a tool to **keep track of time right beside the cursor**.

This project was more than just a coding exercise; it was a realization of a concept that came from **recognizing a need in my own workflow**. Learning to program in Swift allowed me to take control of the entire process, from the initial idea to the finished product, reinforcing the power of **integrating design and development skills**.
