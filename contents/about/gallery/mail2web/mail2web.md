Emails are already a way to publish, just to a limited audience. I wrote a [Google Apps script](https://github.com/sryo/GmailScripts/blob/master/email2Web.gs) that adds a public folder to your Gmail account. Write an email, label it, and now it's a blog post.

The script doesn't change how I write. It just changes where the words end up. The best tool is sometimes just a bridge between behaviors you already have.
