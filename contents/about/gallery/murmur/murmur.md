Push-to-talk voice chat in the browser. No accounts, no server, no install. Open the page, share the link, hold to talk. [Murmur](https://sryo.github.io/murmur/).

It uses Trystero over Nostr relays for peer-to-peer WebRTC. The audio stays between participants. You can whisper privately by holding on a specific peer. The UI is deliberately non-traditional.
