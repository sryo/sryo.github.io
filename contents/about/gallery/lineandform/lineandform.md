Why is it so hard to keep a portfolio updated? It should be simple: show your work. But for me, it always triggers a deep-seated panic. Perfectionism is just a fancy word for [**All or Nothing
**](https://untested.sonnet.io/notes/perfectionism-is-fight-or-flight/).

We either try to brute-force perfection, obsessing over details, and demanding absolute control before we've even begun—or run away from the tension, procrastinating, and abandoning the work because the weight of doing it "right" feels crushing. In both cases, we burn out and ship nothing.

This realization led to **LineAndForm**. I needed a tool that wouldn't let me "fight" with complex architectures or "fly" away from the work. I needed a padded room for my creativity.

[`build.sh`](https://github.com/sryo/sryo.github.io/blob/master/build.sh) is a brute-force solution to a psychological problem. It takes folders and files and turns them into a website. No databases, no complex build pipelines, no excuses. It creates a safe space where I can't get lost in the details, forcing me to focus on the content.

It is an imperfect tool for an imperfect creator, and that is exactly why it works.
