### The Portfolio Paradox
Why is it so hard to keep a portfolio updated? It should be simple: show your work. But for me, it always triggers a deep-seated panic.

### Response:
Perfectionism is just a fancy word for [**Fight or Flight**](https://untested.sonnet.io/notes/perfectionism-is-fight-or-flight/).

**Fight** - We try to brute-force perfection. We obsess over details, over-prepare, and demand absolute control over the outcome before we've even begun. We convince ourselves that if we just work harder, we can eliminate all risk. In practice? We burn out and ship nothing.

**Flight** - We run from the tension. We procrastinate, finding endless distractions to avoid the vulnerability of starting. We abandon the work because the weight of doing it "right" feels crushing. In practice? We burn out and ship nothing.

### Enter LineAndForm
This realization that my own brain was working against me is what led to **LineAndForm**.

I needed a tool that wouldn't let me "fight" with complex architectures or "fly" away from the work. I needed a padded room for my creativity.

[`build.sh`](https://github.com/sryo/sryo.github.io/blob/master/build.sh) is a brute-force solution to a psychological problem. It takes folders and files and turns them into a website. No databases, no complex build pipelines, no excuses. It creates a safe space where I can't get lost in the details, forcing me to focus on the content.

It is an imperfect tool for an imperfect creator, and that is exactly why it works.
