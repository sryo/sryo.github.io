People spend over 10 hours a day on screens. Teens average nearly 9 hours daily. Social media, algorithmic feeds, and persistent notifications keep us hooked.

I designed [ZenTrate](https://github.com/sryo/scriptables), a set of iOS widgets using Scriptable, inspired by **digital minimalism** and old point-and-click adventure games.

ZenTrate replaces cluttered screens of colorful icons with a **calm commands palette focused on verbs**—"Pay" instead of navigating through a bank app, "Set Timer" instead of opening the clocks app. Frequently used actions get bigger. The idea is to reduce friction for what you actually want to do, not what apps want you to do.
