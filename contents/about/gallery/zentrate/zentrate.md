#### What if icons are the problem?

People spend over 10 hours a day on screens. Teens average nearly 9 hours daily. Digital addiction has become a significant concern, driven by social media, algorithmic feeds, and persistent notifications. In response, I designed [ZenTrate](https://github.com/sryo/scriptables)—a set of iOS widgets using Scriptable—drawing from digital minimalism and the simplicity of old point-and-click adventure games. ZenTrate replaces cluttered screens of colorful icons with a calm commands palette focused on verbs like "Pay" instead of navigating through a bank app, or "Set Timer" instead of opening the clocks app. By adapting to user behavior and enlarging frequently used actions, we can offer a more intentional and streamlined approach to technology use aiming to reduce the cognitive load and help users manage their screen time more effectively.
