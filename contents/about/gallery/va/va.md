title: "Va: What if sending money felt like using a calculator?"

Argentine banking apps are cluttered. Sending money takes too many taps through too many screens. Traditional apps follow the bank's data model: accounts, then recipients, then amounts. That's not how you think about sending money. You start with how much.

Va (as in "la plata va y viene", money comes and goes) puts the amount first. Type what you're sending, pick who gets it, confirm with Face ID. Three taps. Every traditional banking flow compressed into one screen. The app connects to your bank accounts through an aggregator API and moves real money between them.

No balance displays. No transaction graphs. No feature creep. Just a calculator that happens to move money.

I'm still testing whether this actually works better or if I've over-simplified.
