title: "Va: What if sending money felt like using a calculator?"

Argentine banking apps are cluttered. Sending money takes too many taps through too many screens. I wanted to test an idea: what if the interface was just a numpad?

Va (as in "la plata va y viene"—money comes and goes) puts the amount first. Type what you're sending, pick who gets it, confirm with Face ID. The app connects to your bank accounts through an aggregator API and moves real money between them.

It's an experiment in minimal finance UI. No balance displays, no transaction graphs, no feature creep. Just a calculator that happens to move money. I'm still testing whether this actually works better or if I've over-simplified.
