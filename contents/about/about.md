### About Me

Hi, I'm Mateo Yadarola, a Product Designer who values the journey as much as the destination. My design journey spans over two decades, with more than ten years in leadership roles.

I'm currently at Continental Finance, where I'm shaping a mobile home banking app catering to users with poor credit scores. Beyond my 9-to-5, I'm an experimenter, a creator of side projects that aim to enhance the digital experience. Check out my GitHub; it's my digital playground where tools like ChronoMouse and MenuMaestro come to life.

Feel free to connect with me:

I believe that creativity is a muscleâ€”one that must be exercised regularly to be strengthened. This philosophy drives not only my professional work but also my passion for personal projects and experimentation.

Join me as I explore the question: "What if...?" in design and technology. Each project below represents a different way I've challenged myself to think creatively, push the boundaries of what's possible in our digital world, and find joy in the journey of creation and problem-solving.
