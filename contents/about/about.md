## Hi, I'm Mateo

I'm a product designer who asks **"what if?"** a lot. What if cursors told time? What if portfolios were just bash scripts? What if I stopped waiting for perfect and just shipped things?

Twenty years of designing, ten of those leading teams. Currently making fintech less intimidating at Continental Finance. But the work I'm proudest of usually happens after hours—small tools and experiments that scratch my own itches.

## I believe creativity is a muscle

Use it or lose it. That's why I build things on the side. Not to launch startups or grow audiences, but to **stay curious** and **keep making**. Some of these projects are useful. Some are just weird. All of them taught me something.
