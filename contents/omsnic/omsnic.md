## Overview

Applying for liability insurance is rarely fun, but for Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeons, it was a nightmare. The process involved **112 different forms**. This **bureaucratic maze** was a significant barrier to entry, causing frustration and drop-offs.

## Objective

To **turn 112 different forms into one**, creating a **fast and compelling onboarding flow** for surgeons.

## My Role

I **led the UX design** to streamline this complex process. My goal was to **hide the complexity** of the insurance backend behind a simple, conversational interface.

## Making Things Happen

### The Consolidation
We didn't just digitize the forms; we **rethought the entire data collection process**.
- **Conversational Design:** We iterated on multiple ideas for a conversational quoting tool. Instead of a wall of inputs, we asked questions one by one, allowing surgeons to provide information naturally.
- **User Testing:** We put prototypes in front of surgeons early. Their feedback was critical in refining the language and flow to match their mental model, not the insurance company's database schema.

## Results

METRICS:
- **112 → 1** forms consolidated
- **90%** reduction in application time
- **100%** digital experience

## Reflection

This project highlighted the **power of UX to transform even the most mundane and complex tasks**. By focusing on the user's journey rather than the system's requirements, we turned a painful obligation into a smooth interaction.
