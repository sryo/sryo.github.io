## Overview

Applying for liability insurance is tedious for most people, but for Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeons, it was worse. The process involved **112 different forms**. Surgeons dropped off constantly.

## Objective

To **turn 112 forms into one**, creating a **fast onboarding flow** for surgeons.

## My role

I **led the UX design** to streamline this process. My goal was to **hide the complexity** of the insurance backend behind a simple, conversational interface.

## Making things happen

### The consolidation
We didn't just digitize the forms; we **rethought the entire data collection process**.
- **Conversational design:** We iterated on multiple ideas for a conversational quoting tool. Instead of a wall of inputs, we asked questions one by one, allowing surgeons to provide information naturally.
- **User testing:** We put prototypes in front of surgeons early. Their feedback shaped the language and flow to match how they actually think about their practice—not how the insurance company's database was structured.

## Results

METRICS:
- **112 to 1** forms consolidated
- **90%** reduction in application time
- **100%** digital experience

## Reflection

By focusing on how surgeons actually wanted to provide information, we turned a frustrating process into something they could finish in minutes.
