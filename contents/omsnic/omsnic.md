## Overview

Applying for liability insurance is tedious for most people, but for Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeons, it was worse. The process involved **112 different forms**. Surgeons dropped off constantly.

## Progressive disclosure

We replaced the wall with a conversation. One question at a time.

The system validates each answer before moving forward. If a surgeon enters an invalid license number, they see the error immediately, not after submitting 30 fields. This keeps context tight and reduces cognitive load.

## Branching logic stays invisible

Different states require different coverage types. A surgeon in California sees questions about earthquake liability. One in Florida sees hurricane-related questions. The branching happens behind the scenes. Users only see questions relevant to their situation.

We tested prototypes with surgeons early. Their feedback shaped the language to match how they think about their practice, not how the insurance database is structured.

## Results

METRICS:
- **112 to 1** forms consolidated
- **90%** reduction in application time
- **100%** digital experience

The process that took hours now takes minutes.
