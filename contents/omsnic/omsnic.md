### Protecting Your Business: Improving Liability Insurance Applications

**Client:** OMSNIC - Finance and insurance

**Overview:** How do we turn 112 different forms into one to create a fast and compelling onboarding flow for Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeons?

In order to streamline the onboarding process for Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeons, our team set out to consolidate the 112 different forms they were required to fill out.

We began by iterating over multiple ideas for a conversational quoting tool, allowing surgeons to quickly and easily provide the necessary information. After conducting user testing and gathering feedback, we refined and improved the tool, creating a fast and compelling onboarding experience for surgeons. This streamlined process has improved the user experience and made it easier for surgeons to complete the onboarding process.
